A sentence embedding pipeline using sentence-transformers library using ['all-MiniLM-L6-v2'](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) model.

Sentence Embedding refers to a numeric representation of a sentence in the form of a vector of real numbers, which encodes meaningful semantic information.
It enables comparison of sentence similarity by measuring the distance or similarity between these vectors.
